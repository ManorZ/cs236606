    "- **_mandel_parallel_critical.c_** - implementation using critical sections for synchronization of a single variable.\n",
    "- **_mandel_parallel_atomic.c_** - implementation using atomic operations for synchronization of a single variable.\n",
    "- **_mandel_parallel_false_sharing.c_** - implementation with global array of variables, each thread updates its own variable, creating false sharing (then a single thread reduce the results). \n",
    "- **_mandel_parallel_padding.c_** - as before, implementation with global array of variables, now using padding to prevent false sharing. \n",

    "* the super-linear speedup at 16 actually makes sense, since at #cores>12 we leave a single CPU, and gets more L3 & L2 cache resources. That plus the fact that each thread needs less memory  (smaller working set), leads to less cache conflicts and higher performance.\n",
    "* On the other hand, I expected some bigger diffrences between the false sharing & the padding, for example.\n",
    "    * I also checked, and each L1 cache line in Xeon 6128 Gold is 64 Bytes. Current compiler interprets *int as 4[B] word, so we have 16 words per eac cache line, not 8.<br>\n",
    "    * To check this hypothesis, I created 2 versions of *mandel_parallel_padding.c: *_08pad & *_16pad.\n",
