    "The serial program in _mandel_serial.c_ loops over a grid of points (5000x5000 points) in the complex plane which contains the Mandelbrot set, and tests each point to see whether it is inside or outside the set.\n",

    "#### Edit the following files to implement parallelization with CPU threads for the given serial code using OpenMP according to the following requirements:\n",
    "- **_mandel_parallel_critical.c_** - implementation using critical sections for synchronization of a single variable.\n",
    "- **_mandel_parallel_atomic.c_** - implementation using atomic operations for synchronization of a single variable.\n",
    "- **_mandel_parallel_false_sharing.c_** - implementation with global array of variables, each thread updates its own variable, creating false sharing (then a single thread reduce the results). \n",
    "- **_mandel_parallel_padding.c_** - as before, implementation with global array of variables, now using padding to prevent false sharing. \n",
    "- **_mandel_parallel_reduction.c_** - implementation with the reduction clause on a parallel loop construct.\n",
